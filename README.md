[Podcast Generator](http://podcastgenerator.net) (PG) is an open source Content Management System written in PHP 
and specifically designed for podcast publishing. It provides the user with the tools 
to easily manage all of the aspects related to the publication of a podcast, from 
the upload of episodes to its submission to the iTunes store.

PG has been around for more than a decade. The project has been hosted on SourceForge [since 2006] (https://sourceforge.net/p/podcastgen/news/2006/04/first-release/), it has been downloaded [hundreds of thousands
times from Sourceforge servers](https://sourceforge.net/projects/podcastgen/files/stats/timeline?dates=2006-03-28+to+2020-01-01) and is also offered as a preinstalled package (through software bundles such as Softaculous) 
by some of the world's leading Hosting and NAS providers.
